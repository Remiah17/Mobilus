            <h3>Treat others with respect.</h3>
            <p>
              There’s no need to say or do things to make others feel bad or
              upset. Trolling, generally defined as provoking a person/situation
              to get a response, is also not allowed. This rule also encompasses
              intentionally trying to kill users in non-PvP zones (basically
              everywhere but in a PvP arena, the End/Nether or in VMR) which is
              not allowed.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Offensive content is not allowed.</h3>
            <p>
              While some minor amount of swearing is allowed, severe or frequent
              vulgarity, especially when directed at others, is not. Offensive
              item/mob names, skins, minecraft structures and usernames are not
              allowed, and you are required to change or remove any if asked by
              a staff member.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Keep chat family friendly.</h3>
            <p>
              Chat should be family friendly. This means certain subjects are
              not allowed in chat. These include, but are not limited to,
              discussions about sex, politics, religion or drugs. If a staff
              member asks you to move a conversation elsewhere or drop one, you
              should do so.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Advertising is not allowed.</h3>
            <p>
              Advertising other Minecraft servers is strictly banned. You also
              may not advertise websites, YouTube channels, Twitch streams, or
              anything else if it is not related to Mobilus.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Allow moderators to do their jobs.</h3>
            <p>
              You may not attempt to do a moderator’s job in threatening to
              punish players for breaking the rules. You are not allowed to
              argue against any decision made by a staff member regarding
              enforcement of the rules in any public channel. If you do
              disagree, please contact that staff member privately to resolve
              the issue, and if you cannot, contact administration.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Spamming is not allowed.</h3>
            <p>
              Spamming is filling chat with multiple unneeded characters or
              messages. Don't do it. This rule also applies to spamming commands
              that don't necessarily show up in chat (whether it be manually or
              via powertool) or shouting, other chat functions or purchasing
              lottery tickets to the extent of making chat hard to read.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Cheating is not tolerated.</h3>
            <p>
              Cheating in any form is not allowed. Anything that is considered
              to give you an unfair advantage over other players is considered
              cheating. This can include but is not limited to client mods to
              generate items/money easier or faster than otherwise possible,
              abusing server bugs or using alts/friends to gain more than you
              would normally gain on a single account. Generating money/items or
              other assets while AFK is also not allowed. These rules do not
              apply on the VMR server. "Cheating" is legal there.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Trading For Real Items.</h3>
            <p>
              Transactions to buy or sell EcoDollars or other in-game items for
              real money or other external products are not allowed. This
              includes minecraft accounts! The only exception to this is where
              players trade or pay another player in exchange for a purchase in
              their name from our official Mobilus Shop.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Griefing is not allowed.</h3>
            <p>
              Griefing is considered destroying or changing another player’s
              property or buildings without their consent in any protected area.
              Don’t do it.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h3>Do not scam other players, or try to.</h3>
            <p>
              Scamming is taking money, items, work, or anything else of value
              from another player dishonestly. This includes teleporting people
              into PvP areas without their consent. Unlocked chests and items on
              the ground on Mobilus are considered fair game.
